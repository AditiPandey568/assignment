##Git and Github:
Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, without interfering with each other's work.
Git tracks changes to files and directories over time, allowing developers to revert to previous versions if needed.

##Agile Practices:
Agile is a methodology or approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, customer feedback, and incremental delivery. It originated as a response to traditional "waterfall" methods, which involved sequential phases of development (requirements, design, implementation, testing) with limited flexibility for change once a phase was completed.
